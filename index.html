                    <p class="Paragraph">
                        Hello there fellow adventurer. My name is Erion Bajrami,<Br> a student and a risk taker with some experience as a QA engineer, mostly freelance with some mentorship of course. <br>
                        I worked as a Team Director/Leader in the high school program<br> “IT Club” of teaching, directing and creating which is dedicated to further
                        technological literacy to elderly or youth.<br> Throughout coursework, my team and I had successfully created web page for furniture,
                        which more of it was learning teamwork and the importance of communication.<br>
                        Additionally, in coursework I had to continually be creative in my approach to developing the site that would be compelling and effective.<br>
                        As a result of our efforts, our group got recognized by the municipality of Gjilan and the governor of Gjilan.<br>
                        I’m excited at the prospect of bringing the skills I developed throughout my experiences.
                    </p>
